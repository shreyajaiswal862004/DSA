# [Get Min from Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/get-minimum-element-from-stack/1?utm=codolio)
## Medium
Implement a class&nbsp;SpecialStack&nbsp;that supports following operations:

push(x) –&nbsp;Insert an integer x into the stack.
pop() –&nbsp;Remove the top element from the stack.
peek()&nbsp;–&nbsp;Return the top element&nbsp;from the stack.&nbsp;If the stack is empty, return -1.
getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time. If the stack is empty, return -1.
isEmpty()&nbsp;–&nbsp;&nbsp;Return true if stack is empty, else false

There will be a sequence of queries&nbsp;queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x&nbsp;:&nbsp;Call push(x)
2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Call&nbsp;pop()
3:&nbsp;Call peek()
4: Call getMin()
5:&nbsp;Call isEmpty()

The driver code will process the queries, call the corresponding functions, and print the outputs of peek(), getMin(), isEmpty() operations.You only need to implement the above five functions.
Examples:
Input: q = 7, queries[][] = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3], [2], [4], [1, 1], [4]]
Output: [3, 2, 1]
Explanation: 
push(2): Stack is [2]
push(3): Stack is [2, 3]
peek(): Top element is 3
pop(): Removes 3, stack is [2]
getMin(): Minimum element is 2
push(1): Stack is [2, 1]
getMin(): Minimum element is 1
Input: q = 5, queries[][] = [[1, 4], [1, 2], [4], [3], [5]]
Output: [2, 2, false]
Explanation: push(4): Stack is [4]
push(2): Stack is [4, 2]getMin(): Minimum element is 2peek(): Top element is 2isEmpty(): false
Constraints:1 ≤ q ≤ 1050 ≤ values on the stack ≤ 109
