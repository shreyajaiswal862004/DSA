Consider a party being organized by some people. A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at the party.&nbsp;A square matrix&nbsp;mat[][]&nbsp;of size n * n is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person.You need to return index of the celebrity in the party.If the celebrity does not exist, return -1.Note: Follow 0-based indexing.Examples:Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 0],                 [0, 1, 0],                 [0, 1, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1st person and 1st person does not know anyone. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity person.Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1],                  [1, 1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since both the people at the party know each other. Hence none of them is a celebrity person.Input: mat[][] = [[1]]
Output: 0
