# [Move all negative elements to end](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/move-all-negative-elements-to-end1813/1)
## Easy
Given an unsorted array arr[ ] having both negative and positive integers. Place all negative elements at the end of the array without changing the order of positive elements and negative elements.
Note: Don't return any array, just in-place on the array.
Examples:
Input : arr[] = [1, -1, 3, 2, -7, -5, 11, 6 ]
Output : [1, 3, 2, 11, 6, -1, -7, -5]Explanation: By doing operations we separated the integers without changing the order.
Input : arr[] = [-5, 7, -3, -4, 9, 10, -1, 11]
Output : [7, 9, 10, 11, -5, -3, -4, -1]

Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 106-109&nbsp;≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
