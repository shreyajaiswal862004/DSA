# [Smallest window containing 0, 1 and 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-window-containing-0-1-and-2--170637/1?utm=codolio)
## Easy
Given a string s consisting only of the characters '0', '1' and '2', determine the length of the smallest substring that contains all three characters at least once.
If no such substring exists, return -1.
Examples :
Input: s = "10212"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "102" is the shortest substring that contains all three characters '0', '1', and '2', so the answer is 3.
Input: s = "12121"
Output: -1
Explanation: The character '0' is not present in the string, so no substring can contain all three characters '0', '1', and '2'. Hence, the answer is -1.
Constraints:1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105
