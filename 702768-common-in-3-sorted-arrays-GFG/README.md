# [Common in 3 Sorted Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/common-elements1132/1?utm=codolio)
## Easy
Given three sorted arrays in&nbsp;non-decreasing&nbsp;order, return all common elements in&nbsp;non-decreasing order across these arrays. If there are no such elements return an empty array.Note:&nbsp;Ignore duplicates, include each common element only once in the output.Examples :Input: a[] = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80], b[] = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100], c[] = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]
Output: [20, 80]
Explanation: The elements 20 and 80 appear in all three arrays a, b, and c, making them the only common elements, so the output is [20, 80].Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [6, 7], c[] = [8, 9, 10]
Output: []
Explanation: Since none of the elements in arrays a, b, and c appear in all three arrays, there are no common elements, so the output is [].Input:  a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], b[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2], c[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]Output: [1, 2]Explanation: Ignoring duplicates, 1 and 2 are present in all three arrays, so the output is [1, 2].
