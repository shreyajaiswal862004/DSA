# [Delete Mid of a Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-middle-element-of-a-stack/1?utm=codolio)
## Easy
Given a stack s, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure. The middle element is defined as the floor(size of stack + 1) / 2)-th element from the bottom of the stack (using 1-based indexing).
Note: The output shown by the compiler is the stack from top to bottom.
Examples:
Input: s = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Output: [50, 40, 20, 10]
Explanation: The bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 50. Middle element will be element at index 3 from bottom, which is 30. Deleting 30, stack will look like [10, 20, 40, 50].

Input: s = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: [40, 30, 10]
Explanation: The bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 40. Middle element will be element at index 2 from bottom, which is 20. Deleting 20, stack will look like [10, 30, 40].
Constraints:2 ≤ element of stack ≤ 1052 ≤ s.size() ≤ 104
