# [Previous Smaller Element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/previous-smaller-element/1?utm=codolio)
## Medium
You are given an integer array arr[ ].&nbsp; The task is to find Previous Smaller Element (PSE) for every element in the array.&nbsp;The Previous Smaller Element (PSE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the left of x in the array and is strictly smaller than x.
Note: If no such element exists, assign -1 as the PSE for that position.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2]Output: [-1, 1, 1]Explanation:For 1, there is no element on the left, so answer is -1.For 6, previous smaller element is 1.For 2, previous smaller element is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 0, 3, 4, 5]Output: [-1, 1, -1, 0, 3, 4]Explanation:For 1, no element on the left, so answer is -1.For 5, previous smaller element is 1.For 0, no element on the left smaller than 0, so answer is -1.For 3, previous smaller element is 0.For 4, previous smaller element is 3.For 5, previous smaller element is 4.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
