# [Overlapping Intervals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals--170633/1)
## Medium
Given an array of intervals arr[][] of size n, where arr[i] = [starti, endi] represents the start and end points of the ith interval, merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting array of non-overlapping intervals.Note: Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] such that a ≤ c, are considered overlapping if&nbsp;&nbsp;c ≤ b.
Examples:
Input: arr[][] = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]]
Output: [[1, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]]
Explanation: In the given intervals we have only two overlapping intervals here, [1, 3] and [2, 4] which on merging will become [1, 4]. Therefore we will return [[1, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]].

Input: arr[][] = [[6, 8], [1, 9], [2, 4], [4, 7]]
Output: [[1, 9]]Explanation: In the given intervals all the intervals overlap with the interval [1, 9]. Therefore we will return [1, 9].
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 1050 ≤ starti ≤ endi ≤ 106
