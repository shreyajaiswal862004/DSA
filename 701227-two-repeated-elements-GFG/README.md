# [Two Repeated Elements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/two-repeated-elements-1587115621/1?utm=codolio)
## Medium
You are given&nbsp;an integer&nbsp;array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if x and y are repeating numbers, and x's second appearance comes before the second appearance of y, then the order should be (x, y).
Examples:
Input: n = 4, arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3]
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: In the given array, 1 and 3 are repeated two times, and as 1's second appearance occurs before 2's second appearance, so the output should be 1 3.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 1]
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: In the given array, 1 and 2 are repeated two times and second occurence of 2 comes before 1. So the output is 2 1.

Constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
